Calibrating the exercises to the audience is going to be a challenging task, so I ask you to bear with me if the exercises are too easy or too hard. Every week there will be a poll you can click on to discuss whether the exercise is too easy or too hard and hopefully in a few weeks, I’ll get the level right. Let’s get to it! I will start with the exercise and include a discussion later, in case you want the extra challenge.

Exercise 1 (and Solution)
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

Extras:

Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)
