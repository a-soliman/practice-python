'''
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

def divisors():
    num = int(input("Please provide a num: "))
    return [x for x in range(2, num) if num % x == 0]


print(divisors())
